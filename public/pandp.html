    interactions with the ad); Device-type information (e.g. screen
    dimensions, device brand and model); Information about your activities on
    our website and Services. We may combine information that does not
    directly identify an individual with data collected from other sources and
    disclose the combined information to participating publishers, advertisers
    and ad networks so that they can determine whether to bid on ad inventory
    and in order to improve the relevance of the advertising presented to
    users. We also use the information we collect to host, operate, maintain,
    secure, and further develop and improve our Services, such as to keep
    track of advertising delivery and to measure the effectiveness of
    advertising delivered through our Services, and investigate compliance
    with wordpad's policies and terms and conditions. Some of the third
    parties that we work with may contribute additional data to us directly,
    which we may combine with our own in order to help us provide a better
    service. We do not collect any information that could be used to directly
    identify an individual. wordpad does not engage in activities that require
